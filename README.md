## What this project is
This application is intended to be an alternative way of communication through a text-to-speech system
Users may enter input to be read aloud in their chosen voice or create a profile to access more features.
Features include ‘folder’ objects that hold ‘button’ objects that hold personalized text that can be read aloud when those buttons are clicked. 


## Tools utilized
Flask, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and jwt were used for the backend. Flask is our microframework, SQLite and SQLAlchemy were used for our database creation, and jwt was used for authentication.
For the frontend we used React, Axios for data communication, Stripe api for payment services, and a browser-built-in speech synthesis api for the text to speech functionalities.
